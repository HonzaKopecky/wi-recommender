# Recommender system for Web Intelligence course at AAU

This is my solution of project work of Web Inteligence course at Aalborg University.

Project implements simple recommender system based on SVD-Funk method.

To run this project you will need to create a *data* directory in the root directory of the project. Second step is
to download the MovieLens 100K Dataset. You can get it here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. The
Dataset should be extracted to the *data* directory.
